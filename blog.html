  	<h1 class="mb-3">What is HTML</h1>
    	<p>HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages, it the structure of a web page</p>
      <p>Is a series of elements (tags), which you use to wrap different parts of content to make it look or act in the way you want later on with CSS.<i>(for more advanced styling you also can use a CSS framework like bootstrap!).</i></p>
      <p>With HTML you will let know the web browser what is a paragraph, header, tittle and so on... You will do this by using tags. </p>
    <h3>HTML tags</h3>
      <p>All tags are wrap with "<>", some examples of tags are </p>
      <img  src="assets/tags.jpg" width="100%">
      <p>Tags are useful for search engines, which analyze the site classify the content of the site to know how and when to display the site in the various places on the Internet.</p>
      <p class="mb-3">They are also useful for accessibility because the screen reader reads each header out as you progress through the content, notifying you what a heading is, what is a paragraph, etc. There are two main types of elements.</p>
      <img src="assets/inline-elements.png" width="100%">
   <h3 class="mt-3">Block-level element</h3>
      <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.</p>
      <p>Two commonly used block elements are: &lt;p&gt; and &lt;div&gt;.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">Inline element</h3>
      <p> Inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
      <h3>Self closing tags</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">A self-closing tag in HTML is a kind of HTML tag that does not need to be closed manually by its closing tag, which means it does not have a separate closing tag as &lt;/tag&gt;. Some few self-closing tags are &lt;input/&gt;, &lt;hr/&gt;, &lt;br/&gt;, &lt;img/&gt;, etc.</p>
        <img src="assets/selfclose.png" width="100%">
    <h3 class="mt-3">Attributes</h3>
      <p>Attributes can be used to define things such as the height and width of an image, the style of an element (eg. color, size, font) and the language of the document.</p>
      <p> This how an Anchor tag looks like:  &lt;a href="www.google.com"&gt;This is some text.&lt;/a&gt;</p>
    <img class="" src="assets/fulltag.png" width="100%">
      <h3> Comments </h3>
      <p>HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.Comments can be used to hide content.</p>
      <p> Everything between the <!-- and the --> will be hidden from the display.</p>
    <h2>Class Attribute</h2>
      <p>The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.</p>
      <p>To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space</p>
      <h3>Layout</h3>
      <p>A page layout defines the appearance of a website. An HTML layout is a structure that helps the user navigate through web pages easily. It is a way in which you can design web pages using simple HTML tags.</p>
      <img src="assets/layout.png" width="100%">
      <h3>Forms</h3>
